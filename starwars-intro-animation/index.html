      <h2>Star wars intro animation</h2>
      <p>
        It is a period of civil wars in the galaxy. A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has challenged the
        tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, rebel spaceships have won their first
        victory in a battle with the powerful Imperial Starfleet. The EMPIRE fears that another defeat could bring a
        thousand more solar systems into the rebellion, and Imperial control over the galaxy would be lost forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new battle station. Powerful
        enough to destroy an entire planet, its completion spells certain doom for the champions of freedom.
